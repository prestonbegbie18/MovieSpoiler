    <h2>Movie Quote</h2>
    <p>"Be their hero, Clark. Be their monument, be their angel, be anything

       You never did."-Martha Kent

    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <p>Bruce Wayne was in Metropolis the day Superman stopped General Zod and
       the evil Kryptonians from taking over the world and turning the world
       we know into Krypton. In that fight, Bruce Wayne witnessed his very own
       Wayne Enterprises building crumble. This sparked Batman's hatred for Superman.
       Lex Luthor devises a plan to get the two heroes to fight to the death. Lex
       frames Superman in the deserts of Africa and in the Capital of the United States.
       This sways public opinion of Superman for the entire world. People begin to question him.
       Lex does this because he blames God for not helping him when he needed it most.
       He obviously had a rough childhood. Lex not only frames Superman though, he also
       goes after Batman. Using one of Batman's recent catches, Lex has someone in prison kill
       him to make it look like the bat brand is really a sign of death among inmates in prisons.
       Clark investigates this "Batman" and finds out that he is taking things too far.
       After all the investigations and Batman preps for his fight with Superman, Lex takes
       Martha Kent hostage to really make Superman do what he wants. This ends up working and
       the two heroes go head to head. Batman ends up having Superman weakened by Kryptonite,
       but in his last breath, he asks Batman to save his mother. This changes Batman because
       after all this time, he thought Superman was just an alien here to try and help, but ended up causing trouble.
       This is the moment when Batman sees Superman as part human after all. In the end though, Lex had a bigger plan
       to kill the Kryptonian Hero. Doomsday. Lex unleashes Doomsday on the city and Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman
       rise to the challenge. <span class="spoil-protect">In the end, kyptonite is the only thing that can kill Doomsday, the same kryptonite spear
       that Batman was going to use on Superman. Superman realizes that he is the only one who can finish Doomsday, but
       the kryptonite will weaken him too. It is a sacrifice he must make for the safety of the world. In the end,
       Superman ends up saving the world at the cost of his own life. Funerals were held for both Clark Kent and Superman,
       but there is an even bigger threat on the way. Bruce and Diana Prince must form the Justice League to combat this
       coming threat.</span>
